Q1: Primary Differences Between TensorFlow and PyTorch and When to Choose Each

TensorFlow uses static computational graphs, meaning the computation graph is defined and compiled before execution, which helps in efficient production deployment and scalability. PyTorch uses dynamic computational graphs, allowing more flexibility and easier debugging during runtime, which suits research and experimentation.

TensorFlow has a larger ecosystem, supports multiple languages, and integrates well with deployment tools, making it ideal for production and large-scale applications. PyTorch is more Pythonic and preferred in academic research for prototyping and development speed.

Choose PyTorch for rapid development, research projects, and when ease of debugging is important. Choose TensorFlow for production environments, mobile/embedded deployment, and when working with scalable, complex systems.

Q2: Two Use Cases for Jupyter Notebooks in AI Development

Machine Learning Prototyping: Jupyter Notebooks allow data scientists to prototype models interactively, experimenting with data preprocessing, feature engineering, training, and tuning with real-time feedback.

Data Analysis and Visualization: They are excellent for exploratory data analysis where you write and run code to analyze datasets and generate visual insights, combining code, charts, and narrative text in one document for easy presentation.

Q3: How spaCy Enhances NLP Tasks Compared to Basic Python String Operations

spaCy is optimized for efficient, fast processing of large text datasets with pre-trained models for tasks like named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, and text classification.

It leverages advanced linguistic models and supports multilingual text processing, which is far beyond simple string operations that lack linguistic understanding and scalability. spaCy also handles complex NLP tasks out-of-the-box with higher accuracy and performance.
